# Simple Event Sourced Application

This repository contains the source code for a simple event sourced application. A simplified veterinary domain
is used to aid in breathing some life into the project.

The scope for this project is:

* Create an API-driven application for managing verterinary appointments for canine companions
* Use event sourcing as a persistence mechanism
* Provision a Kubernetes cluster in Azure
* Deploy the application to Kubernetes and access the application over the public internet
* Ensure adequate test coverage

Additional work that isn't in scope but may be done anyway:

* Authentication
* Automated build/deploy of both infrastructure and code using Azure DevOps
* Switch from Azure to AWS

## Motivation

It has been a while since I got to use all of the muscles required by this project, and this is an opportunity to 
work them.
